Document your knowledge of Git, WebStorm, and GitHub by creating a step by step tutorial in your readme file. You need to make a tutorial that you could give to someone else that describes the process of how to use Git and Github. You outside resources as well as my PowerPoint presentations. Cite all references and put the Reference list at the end of the document. 
You must include definitions for the following terms in a separate list aside from your directions.
This will be like a glossary at the end of a text book.
PART 1: Directions on Using Webstorm.
Add a step by step set of directions. Include URLs of any downloaded software. 

**Git & Github**:
First you must install git. Just go to their website, go to downloads, pick the pc that you have, then choose the newest version of git that is best suited for your pc. You can't work GitHub without Git but you can have Git without Github.
After this, you are now gonna create an account on GitHub. Then create a new repository. You can do this by clicking the plus sign thats next to your profile picture. Then Github will ask you to name your respository. 
Now create your new repository. Now you can push a branch to GitHub from git. Doing this allows people to see the changes you've made. These changes can be merged into the main branch if given permission from the owner.
 

Part 2: Glossary to include these terms in a bulleted list.
Bold each of the Glossary words as you use them.  Bold ONLY the glossary word.
